A classification model is a model which classifies a given observation or an event to a fixed set of categories. Suppose I train a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs.

This output can either be a <code>'Cat'</code> or a <code>'Dog'</code>.\n","\n","### To evaluate such a machine learning model which is trained to classify a given observation with at most two labels, a lot of candidate evaluation metrics are available.

You already know from these images that there are 11 cats and 9 dogs. You train a machine learning model to classify these images into cats and dogs.
